                <h2 id="intro-title">Meet the Chef!</h2>
				<h3 id="intro">My Mom: Janice Lee</h3>
                <p class="question">Q1: When did you first start cooking?</p> 
				<p class="answer">"I started cooking in middle school, when I was 13 years old. My parents, so your grandparents, sent me and my siblings away to boarding school. So, I had to learn how to live apart from my parents from a very young age. I'm the second oldest so I also had to cook so I could feed my younger siblings. After a while, cooking became a hobby that I enjoyed."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q2: What's your favorite dish to make?</p>
				<p class="answer">"Back then, I loved making Bulgogi and Japchae. Because I went to boarding school, I was in charge of money for me and my siblings. So I had to learn how to budget our money. Some days we would eat really simple meals with bread, but on the days we could splurge I would make Bulgogi and Japchae. I love both dishes because they're "special occasion" dishes! They're both super healthy and whenever I had the opportunity to make them the day felt really special."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q3: What's the earliest memory you have of enjoying food?</p>
				<p class="answer">"I remember when your grandma made donuts from scratch. People in Korea didn't really know what donuts were when I was a kid, but my mom learned about it from someone in the neighborhood and made it at home one day. It was so cool! I was about 9 years old then and I remember being so amazed as she made the dough from scratch, fried the ring-shaped pieces, and then covered them with sugar before serving. It was the first time I had watched something being cooked from start to finish, so it left a huge impression on me."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q4: What did you love to eat growing up?</p>
				<p class="answer">"I loved anything fried. Fried sweet potato, fried octopus, you name it. There would be this stand right infront of school. So everyday after school was over I would buy a fried snack to eat on the walk home."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q5: Which of your mom's dishes was your favorite?</p>
				<p class="answer">"I really loved her water kimchi. The only time I would be able to have it would be during summer breaks, when I would come back home from school. So that kimchi just screams summer to me. It's also super refreshing to eat."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q6: What is your favorite food now?</p>
				<p class="answer">"I think my Soybean paste soup is unmatched, but also I love it because it's healthy. Everyone in our family seems to love that dish the most when I make it so I would pick that as my favorite. The most important ingredient is the fermented soybean paste. If that doesn't taste good then the whole dish won't taste great either. I don't like any of the ones that they sell in the store. I buy mine from a neighborhood grandma who makes it from scratch at home."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q7: What makes food special to you? Why is it important?</p>
				<p class="answer">"What we eat makes our health. In other words, it's really important that we are intentional with what we put inside our bodies. Food is also important to me because it brings people together. I love eating together as a family and enjoying the same delicious food together. That is a huge blessing and one of the main reasons why I love food. I'm so thankful to have people to cook for and to have people to enjoy food with."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q8: What dish is nostalgic for you and why?</p>
				<p class="answer">"Asado. It's one of the first things I ate after immigrating to the States. I had never tasted anything like it. It was like a whole new world. To this day, I've tried to recreate the taste of the first time I had it but I can't say I've found it yet."</p>
				
				<p class="question">Q9: When did I start helping you cook?</p>
				<p class="answer">"I don't really have a first memory of when you started to cook with me... But I can say that whenever I would need help with cleaning or cutting vegetables you were always volunteering."</p>
